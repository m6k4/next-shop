# Next.js + Strapi shop

Demo: [https://next-shop-m6k4.vercel.app/](https://next-shop-m6k4.vercel.app/)

Simple online store application using Next.js. To create an API I used headless CMS - Strapi, and I managed to solve the payment handling with Stripe.

```bash
npm install

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the webapp.
Open [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337) with your browser to see the backend app.
